## Marco Rojas

### Bio
My name is Marco and I just graduated from Benemérita Universidad Autónoma de Puebla (BUAP) as an Information Technology Engineer.
In the past, I worked with an agency as a freelance developer, creating projects with REST APIs, Express.js, MongoDB, React-Native, React.
My university projects range from C++, Python, PHP, BASH, Java, OpenGL, Docker, and OpenStack.
In my last year, I was also the local leader for the FreeCodeCamp community, and in partnership with Major League Hacking, we held events for the University’s tech community.
Events included classes with Docker and Git 101, and workshops like Python for AI and Web Applications with NodeJs.
I found in Boston a great opportunity to discover new technological trends, learn about startups, and hopefully bring my skills to a growing engineering team.
