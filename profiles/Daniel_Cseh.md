## Daniel Cseh

### Bio
I started to learn programming in highschool.
My favourite programming language so far is that unique type of c mixed with c++ and vica-versa what we learnt in the school and javascript.

### Location
Hungary

### Projects
I don't really have big projects or any kind of them. I have a raspberry pi and an Arduino uno so I try what I find interesting.

### Hobbies & Interests
I'm really into IT and video games but at the same time I like to play basketball, and like to dance.
