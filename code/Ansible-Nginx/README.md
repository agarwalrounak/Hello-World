# Ansible-nginx Hello World

A quick playbook to deploy a "Hello World"-Webpage via ansible.

To test this, if you have vagrant installed, just do `vagrant up` in this directory and the page should be accessible at http://localhost:8080

Don't forget to `vagrant destroy` afterwards, so the VM doesn't keep running.
